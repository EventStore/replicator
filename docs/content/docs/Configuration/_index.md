  Replicator configuration file explained.
---

Replicator uses a configuration file in YAML format. The file must be called `appsettings.yaml` and located in the `config` subdirectory, relative to the tool working directory.

The settings file has the `replicator` root level, all settings are children to that root. It allows using the same format for the values override file when using Helm.

Available configuration options are:

| Option | Description |
| :----- | :---------- |
| `replicator.reader.connectionString` | Connection string for the source cluster or instance |
| `replicator.reader.protocol` | Reader protocol (`tcp` or `grpc`) |
| `replicator.reader.pageSize` | Reader page size (only applicable for TCP protocol |
| `replicator.sink.connectionString` | Connection string for the target cluster or instance |
| `replicator.sink.protocol` | Writer protocol (`tcp` or `grpc`) |
| `replicator.sink.partitionCount` | Number of [partitioned]({{% ref "writers" %}}) concurrent writers |
| `replicator.sink.partitioner` | Custom JavaScript [partitioner]({{% ref "writers" %}}) |
| `replicator.sink.bufferSize` | Size of the sink buffer, `1000` events by default |
| `replicator.scavenge` | Enable real-time [scavenge]({{% ref "scavenge" %}}) |
| `replicator.runContinuously` | Set to `false` if you want Replicator to stop when it reaches the end of `$all` stream. Default is `true`, so the replication continues until you stop it explicitly. |
| `replicator.filters` | Add one or more of provided [filters]({{% ref "filters" %}}) |
| `replicator.transform` | Configure the [event transformation]({{% ref "Transforms" %}}) |
| `replicator.transform.bufferSize` | Size of the prepare buffer (filtering and transformations), `1000` events by default |

## Enable verbose logging

You can enable debug-level logging by setting the `REPLICATOR_DEBUG` environment variable to any value.

## Example configuration

The following example configuration will instruct Replicator to read all the events from a local cluster with three nodes (`es1.acme.org`, `es2.acme.org` and `es3.acme.org`) using TCP protocol, and copy them over to the Event Store Cloud cluster with cluster ID `c2etr1lo9aeu6ojco781` using gRPC protocol. Replicator will also call an HTTP transformation function at `https://my.acme.org/transform`.

The global order of events will be the same, as `partitionCount` is set to one.

Scavenge filter is disabled, so Replicator will also copy deleted events, which haven't been scavenged by the server yet.

```yaml
replicator:
  reader:
    protocol: tcp
    connectionString: "GossipSeeds=es1.acme.org:2113,es2.acme.org:2113,es3.acme.org:2113; HeartBeatTimeout=500; DefaultUserCredentials=admin:changeit; UseSslConnection=false;"
    pageSize: 2048
  sink:
    protocol: grpc
    connectionString: "esdb://admin:changeit@c2etr1lo9aeu6ojco781.mesdb.eventstore.cloud:2113"
    partitionCount: 1
  transform:
    type: http
    config: https://my.acme.org/transform
  scavenge: false
  filters: []
  checkpoint:
    path: "./checkpoint"
```
